# PropositionalLogic.jl

A Julia implementation of Propositional Logic (see [PropositionalLogic.md](https://github.com/aidanjbailey/PropositionalLogic.jl/blob/master/PropositionalLogic.md)).

## Motivation

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is an open-source, high-performance, dynamically typed, jit-compiled programming language developed by MIT.
While an imperative language at its core, Julia rewards functional techniques as they compliment 
[multimethods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch) and [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching).
If one thinks of Julia inheritance as a tree, inner-nodes can be abstract types while only leaves can be concrete structs.
This design decision promotes composition as a means of sharing functionality rather than relying heavily on inheritance.
